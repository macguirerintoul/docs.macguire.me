# Home Assistant

## Reverse proxy

<Callout type="info">
	The proxy to Home Assistant must have WebSocket support enabled.
</Callout>

Without proper configuration, Home Assistant will reject requests coming from a proxy with `400: Bad Request`.
If the proxy server is a Docker container (e.g. Nginx Proxy Manager), the trusted
proxy must be the IP address assigned to the container by Docker. Add the following
to `configuration.yml`:

```yml
http:
  use_x_forwarded_for: true
  trusted_proxies:
    - XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX # Docker IP of proxy server
```
