# WordPress

## Cannot create directory when uploading files

<Callout type="warning">
	The user & group `apache:apache` are specific to RHEL/CentOS systems.
</Callout>

```bash
sudo chown -R apache:apache wordpress
```

## `.htaccess` to redirect to subdirectory

<Callout type="warning">
	By default, Apache doesn't listen to `.htaccess` files; they must be
	[enabled](/apache#enable-htaccess-files).
</Callout>

```apache
RewriteEngine on
RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^domain-name.com$ [NC,OR]
RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^www.domain-name.com$
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !folder/
RewriteRule (.*) /folder/$1 [L]
```

## Dropdown navigation items are always shown

This is caused by submenu `<ul>` elements not having the class `dropdown-menu` which tells Bootstrap to hide the element unless hovered.

Check for a custom `class-walker-nav-menu.php` in `wp-includes`. This file can be modified to change the output HTML of menu items.

⚠️ Edits should not be made to the file directly, rather it should be [extended](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/wp_nav_menu/).

For a quick fix, add `dropdown-menu` to the `$classes` variable in the `start_lvl` function.

## Gravity Forms CSS issues

When "No-Conflict Mode" is enabled in Gravity Forms settings, the path to Gravity Forms CSS is not set correctly in Chrome.

## Images don't maintain aspect ratio

This is likely due to `width` and/or `height` attributes present on the image which are added by WordPress (not sure why yet). To fix this, use the following CSS (currently in the Custom CSS section of Appearance)

```css
img[class*="wp-image-"] {
	height: auto; /* Make sure images with WordPress-added height and width >attributes are scaled correctly */
}
```

## Homepage works, but subpages give a server 404

To get this to work, we need the proper `.htaccess` in the root directory (`/var/www/html`) as well as a second `.htaccess` in the WordPress directory (`/var/www/html/wordpress`) so that WordPress can handle the requests for post names as URLs, which are in the same structure as directories

`/var/www/html`

```
RewriteEngine on
RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^domain-name.com$ [NC,OR]
RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^www.domain-name.com$
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !folder/
RewriteRule (.*) /folder/$1 [L]
```

or

```
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
RewriteEngine on
RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^(www.)?carmster.com$
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/wordpress/
#RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/p/
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ /wordpress/$1
RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^(www.)?carmster.com$
RewriteRule ^(/)?$ wordpress/index.php [L]
</IfModule>
```

`/var/www/html/wordpress`

```
RewriteEngine on
RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^carmster.com$ [NC,OR]
RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^www.carmster.com$
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !wordpress/
RewriteRule (.*) /wordpress/$1 [L]
```

or

```
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
RewriteEngine On
RewriteBase /
RewriteRule ^index\.php$ - [L]
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule . /index.php [L]
</IfModule>
```
