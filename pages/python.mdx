# Python

Python is managed via `asdf`. Ensure that there is no Python installation via Homebrew, otherwise things will be messed up.

<Callout type="info">
	Vim and other packages installed using Homebrew require Python, so they may
	try to install it as a dependency if it isn't installed already.
</Callout>

## Install

```zsh
asdf plugin-add python
asdf install python latest
```
